# Azure Landing Zones Demo

Demonstration of various infrastructure as code and pipeline components to deploy [Azure Landing Zones](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/).

## Azure landing zone conceptual architecture

![Azure landing zone conceptual architecture](docs/azure-landing-zones.svg)

The conceptual architecture is greatly simplified compared to the official one, as we empower DevOps teams to build and run their own thing.

We do not want to manage network from a centralized perspective. All applications will be deployed as islands with no inter-network connectivity.

## Online Landing Zones

These are the most important landing zones - all *newer* applications should be deployed here - even if data resides on-premises.

Connection to on-premises resources should be managed using zero-trust approaches with resources like:

- [Azure Relay](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-relay/)
- [Azure Service Bus](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/)
- [Azure API Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/)
- [Azure Arc](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/azure-arc/)

## Corp Landing Zones

Corp landing zones should exclusively be used for lift-and-shift scenarios (and avoided all together if possible). This is reserved for applications which do not support modern authentication and relies on Kerberos (Windows Active Directory).

## Policy-driven Governance

The primary focus is on [Policy-driven governance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/design-principles#policy-driven-governance).

## Continuous Deployment

Landing zones are deployed using GitHub Actions.
